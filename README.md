# Tetoka API

This is the Tetoka API. This version of the api is a nodeJS Express application
using express-graphql to create a GraphQL service layer for MongoDB based services.  
The current live prototype of this app is hosted [here](https://radiant-reef-72314.herokuapp.com/) as a Full stack application. This api will replace the current express backend api.

Planned Changes and Additions:

- MongoDB service layer
- GraphQL integration
- Solidity Smart Contracts

Tetoka aims to bridge the gap between cryptographic payment networks and incentivised learning.
